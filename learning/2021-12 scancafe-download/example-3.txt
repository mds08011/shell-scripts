
echo "http://fake.url/334.pdf natasha.pdf
http://fake.url/5536.pdf wombat.pdf
http://fake.url/2.pdf tau.pdf" |
awk '{print "wget "$1" -O "$2}' |
bash



I don't know how much of it makes sense, but just put it all in a script file (in your home dir), with a name like dlfiles.sh, and then run:

Code:

bash ~/dlfiles.sh

For each in the echo statement, put in the URL, followed by the desired filename.
