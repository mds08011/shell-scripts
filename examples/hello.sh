#  Hello World

# Programmers often learn new languages via learning the hello world program. It’s a simple program that prints the string “Hello World” to the standard output. Then, use an editor like vim or nano to create the file hello-world.sh and copy the below lines into it.


echo "Hello World"

# Save and quit the file. Next, you need to make this file executable using the below command.

# $ chmod a+x hello-world.sh

# You can run this using any of the below two commands.

# $ bash hello-world.sh
# $ ./hello-world.sh

# It will print out the string passed to echo inside the script.
