# Print Number of Files or Directories
# The below Linux bash script finds the number of files or folders present inside a given directory. It utilizes the Linux find command to do this. First, you need to pass the directory name to search for files from the command line.
# The program will ask the user to try again if the specified directory isnâ€™t available or have permission issues.
